You are free to use this app for personal use and non commercial usage. Because Fancybox requries payment and domain registration to use for commercial use, this disclaimer must be added.  You can pay it directly to Fancybox here (http://fancybox.net/) or for a small additional fee you can contact me at (nick@nicholasbydesign.com) and I will handle the payments for you as well as any support questions you may have.
